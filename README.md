# Twilio Verse of the Day Setup

This project makes use of the new Twilio Runtime service (functions as a service) and the Twilio Studio service for building flow based programmable SMS/Voice.

There are 3 files in this repo for obtaining the current VOTD (Verse of the Day), verse text | verse image | verse say (audible for calls).

Twilio Studio parses the returned TwiML from these functions and returns the corresponding SMS/MMS/Voice to the user.
